# 🤖 **AI Agent Operating Manual**

*Essential protocols for AI agents working on the CertNode project*

## 📋 **MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY SESSION**

### 🔄 **Documentation Updates (CRITICAL)**

**MUST UPDATE ON EVERY COMMIT:**
1. **BILLION_DOLLAR_BLUEPRINT.md** - Update current status, mark completed items, add new insights
2. **Relevant documentation** - Update any docs that touch the changes made
3. **TODO tracking** - Use TodoWrite tool to track progress throughout session

**Format for roadmap updates:**
```markdown
- [x] **Completed item** - Brief description of what was accomplished
- [ ] **🚨 CURRENT PRIORITY:** What's being executed now
- [ ] **Next item** - What comes next
```

### 📝 **Commit Protocol**

**EVERY commit must:**
1. **Update strategic documentation** before committing code
2. **Include status in commit message** - Reference roadmap phase
3. **Always push after commit** - Never leave uncommitted work
4. **Use descriptive messages** that explain both technical and strategic impact

**Commit message template:**
```

### 🎯 **Strategic Context Maintenance**

**Always remember:**
- **Vision:** Billion-dollar receipt infrastructure empire
- **Current phase:** Phase 1 - Prove the Standard Works (0-6 months)
- **Key insight:** Professional foundation + standards positioning (not SaaS service)
- **Positioning:** Universal receipt protocol owner, not service vendor

### 🔧 **Technical Decision Framework**

**When making technical choices:**
1. **Standards-first:** Will this position us as protocol owner?
2. **Ecosystem thinking:** How does this enable other implementations?
3. **Infrastructure scale:** Does this support billion-transaction volume?
4. **Enterprise credibility:** Does this meet Fortune 500 requirements?
5. **Developer adoption:** Will this drive viral developer usage?

## 🚀 **Current Execution Context**

### **Active Strategy: Hybrid Approach**
- **Foundation:** Enterprise-grade professional infrastructure
- **Messaging:** Universal receipt standard (not SaaS tool)
- **Revenue model:** Usage-based infrastructure pricing
- **Competition positioning:** Protocol owner building ecosystem

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **Professional site infrastructure** - JWKS, trust center, security headers
2. **Standards governance signals** - Position as protocol steward
3. **Developer-first experience** - Interactive docs, test vectors
4. **Usage metering foundation** - Infrastructure for scaling

### **Phase 1 Success Metrics**
- **1,000+ developers** using CertNode
- **Enterprise credibility** established
- **Standards positioning** recognized
- **Revenue model** proven

## 📊 **Context for Future Sessions**

### **What We've Built**
- ✅ **Three production SDKs** (Python, Go, Rust)
- ✅ **Comprehensive examples** and documentation
- ✅ **Cross-language test vectors** for compatibility
- ✅ **Strategic roadmap** with billion-dollar vision
- 🚨 **EXECUTING:** Professional infrastructure foundation

### **What's Next**
- Professional JWKS endpoint with rotation
- Trust center with governance transparency
- Interactive OpenAPI with ecosystem positioning
- Public test vectors for standards compliance
- Usage metering for infrastructure scaling

### **Key Files to Monitor**
- `BILLION_DOLLAR_BLUEPRINT.md` - Strategic roadmap (UPDATE ALWAYS)
- `vercel.json` - Infrastructure configuration
- `web/*.html` - Site positioning and messaging
- `public/.well-known/jwks.json` - Standards compliance
- `sdk/` - Developer experience

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

**We're on track when:**
- Documentation reflects current reality
- Commits advance both technical and strategic goals
- Positioning consistently emphasizes standards over service
- Every change considers billion-dollar infrastructure scale

**Red flags:**
- SaaS-first thinking (pricing tiers, service vendor positioning)
- Missing documentation updates
- Technical work without strategic context
- Uncommitted or unpushed work

## 📚 **Essential Reading**

Before starting work, review:
1. **BILLION_DOLLAR_BLUEPRINT.md** - Current strategic context
2. **Latest commit messages** - Recent progress and decisions
3. **Current branch state** - What's in progress

## 🔄 **End-of-Session Protocol**

**Before ending any session:**
1. ✅ Update BILLION_DOLLAR_BLUEPRINT.md with progress
2. ✅ Commit all changes with strategic context
3. ✅ Push to remote repository
4. ✅ Update TodoWrite with current status
5. ✅ Note any strategic insights or pivots

---

**Remember:** We're not building a SaaS service. We're building the foundational infrastructure for a billion-dollar receipt ecosystem. Every decision should reinforce this positioning.

🚀 **Mission:** Make CertNode the universal standard for digital receipts, then own the entire ecosystem.
