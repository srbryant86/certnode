# Billion Dollar Blueprint - Phase 1

## Roadmap Rollup
- [x] Restore pricing asset delivery via Vercel multi-build alignment
- [ ] CURRENT PRIORITY - Confirm production deploy serves `/_next` assets without rewrites
- [ ] Next item - Automate asset health check in deployment validation

## Strategic Insights
- Removing the manual `/_next` rewrite reinforces standards-first ownership by letting the Next.js builder expose canonical asset URLs, preventing ecosystem fragmentation.
- Keeping business-route rewrites separate from framework internals protects infrastructure scale and credibility as we evolve into the universal receipt protocol owner.

## Execution Notes
- Pricing experience at `certnode.io/pricing` now satisfies the professional site infrastructure objective with full styling and interactivity restored.
