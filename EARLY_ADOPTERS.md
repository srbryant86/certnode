## üìû Outreach Templates

### Initial Email Template
```
Subject: Universal Receipt Infrastructure - Early Adopter Program

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [Company] is exactly the type of innovative [fintech/API/crypto] company that would benefit from tamper-evident receipt infrastructure.

CertNode is an open standard for cryptographic digital receipts - think "HTTPS for data integrity" or "JSON for audit trails." Instead of building proprietary audit systems, companies implement our RFC-compliant protocol for:

‚Ä¢ Tamper-evident transaction records
‚Ä¢ Cryptographic compliance audit trails
‚Ä¢ Cross-platform receipt verification
‚Ä¢ Standards-based infrastructure (not vendor lock-in)

We're launching an early adopter program for 50 strategic companies. Benefits include:
‚úì Free implementation consultation
‚úì Custom integration assistance
‚úì Priority engineering support
‚úì Standards governance influence

Would you be interested in a 15-minute conversation about how CertNode could enhance [Company]'s audit infrastructure?

Built for infrastructure companies by infrastructure engineers.

Best,
[Name]

P.S. Check out our technical spec: certnode.io/openapi
```

### Follow-up Email Template
```
Subject: Re: Universal Receipt Infrastructure

Hi [Name],

Following up on CertNode - the universal receipt infrastructure standard.

Quick context: We're not building another SaaS service. CertNode is designed as protocol infrastructure (like TCP/IP or HTTP) that any company can implement using our open source libraries.

Three concrete use cases for [Company]:
1. [Specific use case based on their business]
2. [Another relevant application]
3. [Third applicable scenario]

Early adopters get first-mover advantage in receipt-enabled infrastructure plus direct influence on standards governance.

15-minute call to explore fit?
