## Setup Guides

### Kajabi Integration

**What gets tracked:**
- âœ… Offer purchased â†’ Transaction receipt
- âœ… Member logged in â†’ Operations receipt
- âœ… Lesson viewed â†’ Content receipt
- âœ… Course completed â†’ Content receipt
- âœ… Assessment submitted â†’ Content receipt

**Setup steps:**

   - Settings â†’ Webhooks â†’ Add Webhook
   - URL: `https://certnode.io/api/integrations/kajabi`

   - Secret: Your CertNode API key

2. **In CertNode Dashboard:**

   - Paste your API key

3. **Test the integration:**

When a student disputes: "Never got access", you have **cryptographic proof** of their entire journey.

## Receipt Linking

All integration receipts are **automatically linked** to form a complete graph:

### E-commerce Example
```
Shopify Order â†’ Shippo Label â†’ FedEx Tracking â†’ Delivery â†’ Stripe Chargeback â†’ Evidence
```

Every receipt links to the previous one, creating an **unbreakable chain of proof**.

### High-Ticket Example
```
Kajabi Purchase â†’ Course Access â†’ 47 Logins â†’ 12 Lessons â†’ 8 Downloads â†’ Refund Request
```

When a customer claims "never got access", you show them **their own activity log**, cryptographically signed.

## Custom Integrations

Don't see your platform? You can build custom integrations using the CertNode API.

### Example: Custom Webhook Handler

```javascript
// Your server receives platform webhooks
app.post('/my-platform-webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  // Create CertNode receipt
  await fetch('https://certnode.io/api/receipts', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_YOUR_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      domain: 'operations',
      type: 'custom-event',
      data: event,
      parentIds: [] // Or link to previous receipt
    })
  });

  res.json({ success: true });
});
```
