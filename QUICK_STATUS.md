# CertNode Status - Quick Reference
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-02 (Session Complete!)

## âœ… DONE (Working APIs)
- **Receipt Graph DAG:** Fully working (`lib/graph/receipt-graph-service.ts`)
- **Graph API:** `POST /api/v1/receipts/graph` (create with parents)
- **Cross-Product Verification:** âœ… `POST /api/v1/receipts/verify/cross-product`
- **Graph Completeness:** âœ… `GET /api/v1/receipts/graph/{id}/completeness`
- **Batch Operations:** âœ… `POST /api/v1/receipts/batch` (1,000 receipts at once)
- **Webhooks:** âœ… Service + API built (requires DB migration to activate)
- **Animation:** https://certnode.io/platform shows chargeback scenario âœ…

## ðŸŽ‰ WHAT WE BUILT TODAY
1. **Cross-Product Verification** - Prove txâ†’contentâ†’ops chains are valid
2. **Graph Completeness Scoring** - Show "80% complete, add delivery confirmation"
3. **Batch Operations** - Process 1,000+ receipts in parallel
4. **Webhook Notifications** - Real-time events with HMAC signatures

## ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS (To Activate Webhooks)
1. Run database migration: See `prisma/migrations/TODO_ADD_WEBHOOK_MODELS.md`
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_webhook_models
   npx prisma generate
   ```
2. Integrate `fireWebhook()` calls into receipt creation flow
3. Test webhook delivery with real endpoints

## ðŸ’¡ BIGGEST MOAT (Month 2-3)
**Cross-Merchant Network:** Customer trust scores based on receipts across ALL merchants
- Network effects (more merchants = more value)
- Winner-take-all market
- Impossible for competitors to replicate

## ðŸ“Š PRICING (Current & Accurate)
- **Starter:** $49/mo â†’ 1K receipts, 5-level depth
- **Professional:** $199/mo â†’ 5K receipts, 10-level depth
- **Scale:** $499/mo â†’ 10K receipts, unlimited depth
- **Enterprise:** $25K-$150K/yr â†’ custom + cross-merchant network
