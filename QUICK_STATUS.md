## ðŸŽ‰ WHAT WE BUILT TODAY
1. **Cross-Product Verification** - Prove txâ†’contentâ†’ops chains are valid
2. **Graph Completeness Scoring** - Show "80% complete, add delivery confirmation"
3. **Batch Operations** - Process 1,000+ receipts in parallel
4. **Webhook Notifications** - Real-time events with HMAC signatures (ACTIVATED!)

## âœ… WEBHOOKS FULLY TESTED & WORKING
- **Database:** Migration applied (`20251002170349_add_webhook_models`)
- **APIs:** All webhook management endpoints working
- **Integration:** Webhooks fire automatically on receipt creation âœ… TESTED
- **Events:** receipt.created, receipt.verified, content.flagged, graph.linked
- **Coverage:** Content receipts, graph receipts, batch operations all fire webhooks

- **Bug Fixed:** JSON parsing for SQLite event arrays (lib/webhooks/webhook-service.ts:164)
- **Verified:** webhook.site received all 5 POST requests with proper payload & signatures
