# CertNode Status - Quick Reference
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-02

## ✅ DONE
- **Receipt Graph DAG:** Fully working (`lib/graph/receipt-graph-service.ts`)
- **Graph API:** `POST /api/v1/receipts/graph` (create with parents)
- **Graph Traversal:** Find paths, analytics, depth limits by tier
- **Animation:** https://certnode.io/platform shows chargeback scenario

## ❌ MISSING (Must Build)
1. **Cross-Product Verification** - Verify tx→content→ops chain (2-3 hrs)
2. **Batch Operations** - Process 1K receipts at once (2-3 hrs)
3. **Webhooks** - Real-time event notifications (4-5 hrs)
4. **Graph Completeness** - "80% complete" scoring (3-4 hrs)

## 🎯 NEXT ACTION
**Build Cross-Product Verification first** (makes animation real)
- File: `app/api/v1/receipts/verify/cross-product/route.ts`
- Input: Array of receipt IDs
- Output: Chain validity + cryptographic proof + completeness score

## 💡 BIGGEST MOAT (Month 2-3)
**Cross-Merchant Network:** Customer trust scores based on receipts across ALL merchants
- Network effects (more merchants = more value)
- Winner-take-all market
- Impossible for competitors to replicate

## 📊 PRICING (Current & Accurate)
- **Starter:** $49/mo → 1K receipts, 5-level depth
- **Professional:** $199/mo → 5K receipts, 10-level depth
- **Scale:** $499/mo → 10K receipts, unlimited depth
- **Enterprise:** $25K-$150K/yr → custom + cross-merchant network
