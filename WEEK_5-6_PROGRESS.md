### Container Strategy
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized production images
- **Security scanning** integrated into build process
- **Minimal base images** (Alpine Linux) for reduced attack surface
- **Non-root user** execution for enhanced security

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana** for visualization and dashboards
- **Node Exporter** for system metrics
- **Custom exporters** for application-specific metrics

### Logging Architecture
- **Structured JSON logs** with correlation IDs
- **Centralized aggregation** with Elasticsearch/Loki
- **Log retention policies** for compliance
- **Real-time log streaming** for debugging

### CI/CD Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, security scanning
2. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
3. **Building**: Docker images with vulnerability scanning
4. **Deployment**: Staged rollouts with health checks
5. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment verification

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Container build time < 5 minutes
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployments achieved
- [ ] 99.9% uptime SLA maintained
- [ ] Mean time to recovery (MTTR) < 15 minutes
- [ ] Security scan passes with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Automated deployment success rate > 95%

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Development Environment
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (minikube/kind for local)
- Helm 3.x
- GitHub Actions runners

### Production Environment
- Kubernetes cluster (EKS/GKE/AKS)
- Persistent storage for databases
- Load balancer with SSL termination
- Monitoring infrastructure
- Backup and disaster recovery

### Security Requirements
- Secret management system (Vault/K8s Secrets)
- Network policies and ingress rules
- RBAC for service accounts
- Regular security audits
- Compliance monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Create production-ready Dockerfiles
2. Set up Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
3. Implement comprehensive monitoring
4. Build automated CI/CD pipeline
5. Establish security scanning and compliance
