    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    message: 'Too many requests from this IP'
  }),

  // Request sanitization
  sanitizeInput: (req, res, next) => {
    req.body = sanitizeHtml(req.body, {
      allowedTags: [],
      allowedAttributes: {}
    });
    next();
  },

  // Security headers
  securityHeaders: helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {

    },
    hsts: {
      maxAge: 31536000,
      includeSubDomains: true,
      preload: true
    }
  })
};
```

### Availability Controls Implementation

```javascript
// api/src/services/availabilityMonitor.js
class AvailabilityMonitor {
  constructor() {
    this.healthChecks = new Map();
    this.slaMetrics = {
      uptime: 0,
      responseTime: [],
      errorRate: 0
    };
  }

  async performHealthCheck() {
    const checks = {
      database: await this.checkDatabase(),
      redis: await this.checkRedis(),
      hsm: await this.checkHSM(),
      external: await this.checkExternalDependencies()
    };

    const overall = Object.values(checks).every(check => check.healthy);

    // Log to SOC 2 compliance system
    await this.logAvailabilityMetric({
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      status: overall ? 'healthy' : 'degraded',
      checks,
      uptime: this.calculateUptime()
    });

    return { healthy: overall, checks };
  }
}
```

### Processing Integrity Controls

```javascript
// api/src/services/integrityValidator.js
class ProcessingIntegrityValidator {
  async validateSigningProcess(payload, signature) {
    // Validate input completeness
    if (!this.isCompletePayload(payload)) {
      throw new IntegrityError('Incomplete payload received');
    }

    // Validate processing accuracy
    const recomputedSignature = await this.signPayload(payload);
    if (signature !== recomputedSignature) {
      throw new IntegrityError('Signature validation failed');
    }

    // Log integrity check
    await this.logIntegrityCheck({
      payloadHash: this.hash(payload),
      signatureValid: true,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      processingTime: Date.now() - this.startTime
    });

    return true;
  }
}
```

## Continuous Monitoring and Reporting

### Automated Compliance Monitoring

```javascript
// api/src/services/complianceMonitor.js
class SOC2ComplianceMonitor {
  constructor() {
    this.controls = new Map();
    this.evidenceCollector = new EvidenceCollector();
    this.scheduler = new Scheduler();
  }

  async monitorControl(controlId, testFunction) {
    const startTime = Date.now();

    try {
      const result = await testFunction();
      const evidence = await this.evidenceCollector.collect(controlId);

      await this.recordControlTest({
        controlId,
        status: result.passed ? 'effective' : 'deficient',
        evidence,
        testDate: new Date().toISOString(),
        nextTestDate: this.calculateNextTestDate(controlId),
        findings: result.findings || []
      });

      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      await this.recordControlException({
        controlId,
        error: error.message,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      });
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

## Audit Trail and Evidence Management

### Evidence Collection System

```javascript
// api/src/services/evidenceCollector.js
class EvidenceCollector {
  constructor() {
    this.evidenceStore = new EvidenceStore();
    this.retention = {
      auditLogs: '7 years',
      accessLogs: '3 years',
      systemLogs: '1 year'
    };
  }

  async collectEvidence(controlId, evidenceType) {
    const evidence = {
      controlId,
      type: evidenceType,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      collector: 'automated',
      data: await this.gatherEvidenceData(evidenceType),
      hash: null,
      retentionPeriod: this.retention[evidenceType] || '3 years'
    };

    // Create tamper-evident hash
    evidence.hash = this.createEvidenceHash(evidence);

    // Store evidence securely
    await this.evidenceStore.store(evidence);

    return evidence;
  }

  createEvidenceHash(evidence) {
    const data = JSON.stringify({
      ...evidence,
      hash: null // Exclude hash from hash calculation
    });
    return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(data).digest('hex');
  }
}
```
