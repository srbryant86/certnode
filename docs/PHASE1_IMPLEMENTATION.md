- Seeded reference receipts/audit logs and exposed a Prisma-backed overview API.
- Documented setup steps in the project README to align with the DASHBOARD_ARCHITECTURE playbook.
- Shipped the API key management module with create/revoke flows, rate limits, and audit logging.

## Next Targets
- Expose API key rotation and per-key usage analytics dashboards.
- Integrate Stripe customer portal linkages and plan telemetry into the billing module.
- Implement Prisma-backed receipt filtering with pagination surfaces.
- Prepare real-time channels for the activity feed (websocket scaffolding).
