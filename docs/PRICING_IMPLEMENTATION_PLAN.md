## Risk Management Strategy

### **Technical Risks**

**Risk: Transaction limit enforcement breaks existing customers**
- **Mitigation**: Grandfather existing customers, phased rollout
- **Monitoring**: Error rates, customer complaints, support tickets
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flag to disable limits, restore previous logic

**Risk: Overage calculations are incorrect**
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, manual validation, customer review
- **Monitoring**: Billing dispute rates, calculation accuracy audits
- **Rollback Plan**: Manual override system, refund mechanism

**Risk: Performance degradation from new validation logic**
- **Mitigation**: Caching, async processing, performance testing
- **Monitoring**: API response times, database performance
- **Rollback Plan**: Performance optimization, infrastructure scaling

### **Business Risks**

**Risk: Customer backlash over new limits**
- **Mitigation**: Clear communication, value demonstration, gradual rollout
- **Monitoring**: Churn rates, customer feedback, support sentiment
- **Response Plan**: Customer retention campaigns, pricing adjustments

**Risk: Competitors copying pricing model**
- **Mitigation**: Speed of execution, feature differentiation, customer relationships
- **Monitoring**: Competitive intelligence, market analysis
- **Response Plan**: Accelerate innovation, strengthen value proposition

**Risk: Market rejection of premium tiers**
- **Mitigation**: Customer validation, A/B testing, flexible pricing
- **Monitoring**: Conversion rates, trial usage, customer feedback
- **Response Plan**: Pricing adjustments, feature modifications
