  averageDisputeSaved: number;
  breakEvenDisputes: number; // Disputes needed to pay for tier
  roiMultiplier: number;
}

// Example calculations
const protectionMetrics = {
  foundation: {
    costPerMillion: 588, // $49/month for ~$83K monthly volume
    disputePreventionRate: 0.85,
    averageDisputeSaved: 2500,
    breakEvenDisputes: 0.02, // 1 dispute every 4+ years
    roiMultiplier: 4.25
  },
  legalShield: {
    costPerMillion: 6, // $12K/year for $2M volume
    disputePreventionRate: 0.98,
    averageDisputeSaved: 50000,
