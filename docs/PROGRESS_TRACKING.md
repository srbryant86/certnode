## Risk & Blocker Tracking

### Current Blockers (Red - Immediate)
1. **üî¥ Signing Service Down** - Blocks all development/testing
   - **Impact:** Complete feature blocker
   - **Solution:** Docker compose or local node process
   - **Owner:** TBD
   - **ETA:** Week 1

2. **üî¥ Database Migration Pending** - Schema not applied
   - **Impact:** API development blocked
   - **Solution:** Execute migration with proper DATABASE_URL
   - **Owner:** TBD
   - **ETA:** Week 1

### Monitoring (Yellow - Watch)
- None currently identified

### Resolved (Green)
- ~~Vendor API dependencies~~ ‚Üí Eliminated with in-house detection
