# CertNode Unified Platform Implementation Plan

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-27
**Vision:** Complete cryptographic infrastructure for digital trust across three pillars
**Timeline:** 6 weeks to full platform launch

---

## Platform Taxonomy & Vision

### CertNode: Cryptographic Infrastructure for Digital Trust

**Three Pillars of Trust:**

1. **üîÑ Content Authenticity (media)** ‚Üí Assets with a file hash you intend to publish/share
   - Image/video/audio/text/document certification
   - C2PA manifests / provenance chains
   - AI detector scores (in-house, proprietary)
   - File hash verification with cryptographic receipts

2. **‚úÖ Transactions (commerce)** ‚Üí Events around a sale or payout *(LIVE)*
   - Payment receipts, affiliate attribution receipts
   - Consent/offer disclosure acceptance
   - Digital-fulfillment/delivery proof

3. **‚è≥ Operational Trust (compliance/dev)** ‚Üí Controls & system integrity *(PLANNED)*
   - Incident & SLA receipts
   - Build/release provenance (SLSA, SBOM)
   - Report/export integrity receipts
   - Policy/config change attestation

---

## Unified Technical Architecture

### Universal Receipt Envelope
```typescript
interface Receipt {
  id: string;
  type: 'transaction' | 'content' | 'ops';
  subtype: string;  // payment|affiliate|content|incident|build_release|etc
  subject: string;  // URN/URL for the attested object
  claims: Record<string, unknown>;  // Type-specific payload
  ts: string;       // ISO timestamp
  signature: {      // Cryptographic proof (JWS)
    alg: string;    // ES256 or Ed25519
    kid: string;    // Key identifier
    issuer: string; // Issuer URI
    jws: string;    // Compact JWS signature
    createdAt: string;
  };
  version: string;  // Envelope version (default "1.0")
  tenantId: string; // Multi-tenant segregation
}
```

### Shared Infrastructure Components

**‚úÖ Already Implemented:**
- Prisma `Receipt` model with `type` discriminator
- HSM-backed signing service integration
- JWKS endpoint (`/.well-known/jwks.json`)
- API authentication and rate limiting
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Dashboard and verification UI patterns

**üîÑ Being Enhanced:**
- Content-specific fields (hash, metadata, provenance, AI scores)
- Type-aware verification UI panels
- In-house AI detection algorithms

**‚è≥ Planned Extensions:**
- JCS canonicalization for operational trust
- Ops-specific subtypes and claims schemas
- Incident feed and trust page enhancements

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Content Authenticity Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal:** Complete content certification with in-house AI detection

#### Week 1: Critical Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Execute Prisma migration for content fields
- ‚úÖ Spin up signing service locally
- ‚úÖ Implement content API endpoints (`POST /api/v1/receipts/content`)
- ‚úÖ Basic heuristic AI detection (80% accuracy)
- ‚úÖ Content verification endpoints
- **NEW:** JCS canonicalization implementation (prep for operational trust)

#### Week 2-3: Advanced Content Features
- Advanced text AI detection (linguistic patterns, perplexity, fingerprints)
- Advanced image analysis (EXIF, compression artifacts, pixel distribution)
- Content dashboard integration with type filters
- Performance optimization and caching

### Phase 2: Operational Trust Integration (Weeks 4-6)
**Goal:** Complete all three pillars with unified verification

#### Week 4: Operational Trust Foundation
- Extend Prisma schema for `ops` type and subtypes:
  - `incident` - Incident & SLA receipts
  - `build_release` - Build/release provenance
  - `report_hash` - Report/export integrity
  - `policy_change` - Policy/config change attestation
- Implement ops API endpoints with Zod validation
- Add operational trust panels to `/verify` page

#### Week 5: Trust Page & SDK Integration
- Incident feed on `/trust` page (publishable incidents)
- Unified SDK/CLI for all three pillars
- Documentation for all operational trust endpoints
- Security audit and compliance review

#### Week 6: Platform Launch Readiness
- Performance testing across all receipt types
- End-to-end integration testing
- Pilot customer onboarding
- Marketing launch preparation

## Technical Integration Points

### Database Schema Evolution
```sql
-- Current (Content Authenticity)
Receipt {
  type: 'transaction' | 'content'
  contentHash: string?
  contentType: string?
  contentMetadata: Json?
  contentProvenance: Json?
  contentAiScores: Json?
}

-- Phase 2 Extension (Operational Trust)
Receipt {
  type: 'transaction' | 'content' | 'ops'
  subtype: string  -- incident|build_release|report_hash|policy_change
  subject: string  -- URN/URL of attested object
  claims: Json     -- Type-specific claims payload
  // ... existing content fields remain
}
```

### API Endpoint Organization
```
/api/v1/receipts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transaction/        ‚úÖ LIVE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/           üîÑ IMPLEMENTING
