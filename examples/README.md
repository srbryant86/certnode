# CertNode Examples

Open source examples demonstrating common use cases for the CertNode universal receipt standard.

## üéØ Purpose

These examples show how to integrate CertNode into real-world applications across different industries and platforms. Each example demonstrates the infrastructure approach - implementing the standard directly rather than relying on a proprietary service.

## üìÅ Examples

### E-commerce
- **[Order Receipts](./ecommerce/)** - Generate tamper-evident order confirmations
- **[Payment Processing](./payments/)** - Create cryptographic payment receipts
- **[Inventory Tracking](./inventory/)** - Track product authenticity through supply chain

### API Services
- **[REST API Logging](./api-logging/)** - Add receipts to API responses
- **[Webhook Verification](./webhooks/)** - Secure webhook payloads with receipts
- **[Rate Limiting](./rate-limiting/)** - Receipt-based usage tracking

### IoT & Embedded

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Choose your platform:**
   - [Python examples](./python/)
   - [Node.js examples](./nodejs/)
   - [Rust examples](./rust/)
   - [Go examples](./go/)

2. **Pick a use case** from the list above

3. **Follow the README** in each example directory

4. **Adapt for your needs** - these are starting points, not complete solutions

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Philosophy

### Universal Standard Approach
- Examples implement the CertNode standard directly using open source libraries
- No vendor lock-in - receipts work across any compliant implementation
- Focus on interoperability and cross-platform compatibility

### Infrastructure Mindset
- Built for production scale from day one
- Error handling, logging, and monitoring included
- Performance optimization and caching strategies demonstrated

### Security Best Practices
- Proper key management and rotation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Side-channel attack prevention

## üìö Documentation

Each example includes:
- **README.md** - Overview and quick start
- **Implementation guide** - Step-by-step setup
- **Code comments** - Explaining cryptographic operations
- **Test suite** - Validation and edge case testing
- **Performance notes** - Scaling considerations

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome examples from the community!

## üéØ Billion-Dollar Vision

These examples support the vision of CertNode as universal infrastructure:

### Standards Adoption
- Every example shows interoperability between implementations
- Encourages multiple vendors to support the same standard
- Demonstrates competitive collaboration benefits

### Ecosystem Growth
- Real-world use cases drive adoption
- Platform-specific optimizations encourage implementation
- Industry-specific examples target vertical markets

### Network Effects
- More examples = more use cases = more adoption
- Cross-industry learning and pattern sharing
- Community-driven feature development
