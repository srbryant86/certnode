## Email 1: Stripe Integration Opportunity

**To:** developers@stripe.com, partnerships@stripe.com
**Subject:** Universal Receipt Infrastructure - Partnership Opportunity for Stripe

Hi Stripe Team,

I'm Steven Bryant, creator of CertNode - the emerging universal standard for tamper-evident digital receipts. Given Stripe's leadership in payment infrastructure, I wanted to reach out about a potential partnership opportunity.

**The Problem:** Every digital transaction creates receipts, but there's no universal standard for making them tamper-evident and cryptographically verifiable. This creates audit gaps and trust issues, especially in financial services.

**Our Solution:** CertNode provides RFC-compliant, tamper-evident receipts using JWT signatures and JWKS infrastructure. Think "SSL certificates for receipts" - universal, verifiable, and cryptographically secure.

**Stripe Integration Opportunity:**
- Payment receipt plugin that generates CertNode receipts for every transaction
- Automatic tamper-evident audit trails for compliance requirements
- Enhanced customer trust through verifiable payment confirmations
- Positions Stripe as leader in receipt infrastructure standards

**Current Traction:**
- Production-ready SDKs (Python, Node.js, Rust, Go)
- Live at certnode.io with enterprise security infrastructure
- Early enterprise customers already generating millions of receipts monthly
- Growing ecosystem of integrations across fintech and e-commerce

**Next Steps:**
- 30-minute technical demo of the Stripe integration concept
- Proof-of-concept development (we handle the implementation)
- Joint announcement as CertNode's payment infrastructure partner

Would you be interested in a brief technical discussion about how CertNode could enhance Stripe's payment receipt capabilities?
