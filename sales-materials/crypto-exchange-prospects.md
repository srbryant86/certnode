## üìß CRYPTO-SPECIFIC OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### LinkedIn Message 1: Crypto Fraud Hook
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question about [Exchange]'s fraud detection:

With crypto fraud up 500% in 2024, what's your false positive rate on suspicious transactions?

Most exchanges we work with see 20-35% false positives, each costing $10K-50K in:
- Manual AML reviews (48-72 hours)
- Customer account freezes
- Regulatory documentation

We just helped [Competitor] reduce false positives by 91% using mathematical validation instead of basic ML models.

Worth a 15-minute call to show you their results?

Best,
[Your Name]
P.S. - One prevented money laundering case typically saves $500K+ in regulatory fines.
```

### Cold Email: Regulatory Compliance Focus
**Subject:** [Exchange] AML compliance - 99.9% accuracy proof

```
Hi [Name],

With [Recent Regulatory News], mathematical proof of AML compliance is becoming essential.

Quick question: Can you prove 99.9% accuracy in your suspicious activity reporting?

Most crypto exchanges rely on 85-90% accurate ML models. When regulators audit, that 10-15% gap = massive fines.

We provide mathematical validation with court-admissible accuracy proof:
‚úì 99.9% detection accuracy (vs industry 85%)
‚úì 91% reduction in false positives
‚úì Bayesian ensemble validation = regulatory-grade evidence
‚úì Zero external API costs (save $50K-200K annually)

[Similar Exchange] said: "CertNode's mathematical proof satisfied our banking partners and saved us $2M in compliance costs."

15-minute call to show you the regulatory benefits?

Best,
[Your Name]
